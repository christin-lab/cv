      <td><h1>Christin Washington</h1>
      <p><em>Graduate Student in Department of American Studies, UMD College Park</em></p>
      <p>Christin Washington is a weaver, seeing the connections among systems and the faults under our feet. She has a sense of their depth and aims to guide and teach how to know the geography, traverse the depth, and build alternate people centered systems that reorganize how humans see and know.</p>
      <p>She is pursuing her PhD in American Studies at the University of Maryland, College Park where she is focused on digitalityâ€™s place in Black and American life. She aims to investigate how it stretches and remodels the present limits of storytelling and memorialization, warps time, shrinks space, and democratizes resources; all the while remaining attuned to the ways it can reproduce marginalization and obstruct access in the United States. With that, she feels responsible for helping create digital tools that are equitable and humanistic at its core.</p>
      <p>Christin is an alum of Amherst College where she received a B.A. in Black Studies and Political Science. There, she created her Five College Digital Humanities project and Black Studies senior thesis <a href="http://blackbrooklyn.org/">Dare to Remember: A Digital Memorial of Black Brooklyn</a>. She was awarded the Edward T. Jones Prize for her digital brainchild and figurative ode to Black people in the place she has called home.</p>
      <p>A hoarder of quotes, she leaves you with this: Much to be done, and undone.</p>
